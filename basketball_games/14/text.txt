The Portland Trail Blazers took down the San Antonio Spurs, 127-118, at Moda Center on Thursday evening. The Trail Blazers (33-21) staved off a valiant comeback effort by San Antonio (32-25) late in the second half. Portland seemed to be cruising to an easy victory as it took a 21-point lead in the third quarter. The Spurs, however, clawed back, thanks in large part to DeMar DeRozan's 14 third-quarter points. San Antonio cut the deficit to just three points early in the fourth quarter, but the Blazers recaptured their lead with a game-clinching 15-4 run. C.J. McCollum was the driving force behind Portland's strong offense. He led the team with 30 points and hit seven three-pointers in the victory. Damian Lillard, meanwhile, had 24 points and nine assists while also demonstrating unusual energy on the defensive end. Lillard finished with five steals. DeRozan led all scorers with 35 points. He dished out six assists on top of his scoring, and also tallied six rebounds. However, his strong play was not enough to lead his team to a win. The Spurs allowed Portland to shoot over 55 percent and forced only seven turnovers on the night. The Spurs will hope to turn things around as they visit Utah on Saturday. The Trail Blazers, meanwhile, will take to the road with a trip to Dallas on Sunday.
