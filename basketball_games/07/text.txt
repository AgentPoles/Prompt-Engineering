A 14-4 run to start the fourth quarter helped Phoenix (18-60) snap its six-game losing streak. The Suns had established an early double-digit lead thanks to a 40-point second quarter, but the late run helped seal the much-needed win for the last place squad. Cleveland (19-59) battled back to make it a single-digit game again, but Phoenix had plenty of breathing room as it made its way to the final buzzer. As a unit, Phoenix shot over 54 percent from the floor in the win. After a slough of big scoring nights, Devin Booker impressed once again, this time with his passing prowess. Booker recorded a 25-point, 13-assist double-double to lead his team to victory. Josh Jackson recorded a double-double as well, grabbing 10 rebounds while scoring 19 points. Jackson also amassed a career-high five blocks in Monday's win. Cleveland saw big nights from its own young guards. Rookie point guard Colin Sexton continued his dominant post All-Star play, scoring 21 points to lead the team. Off the bench, Jordan Clarkson poured in 20 points. The team also saw 12 rebounds and four assists from center Larry Nance Jr.. Cleveland will continue its road trip with a visit to Sacramento on Thursday.
