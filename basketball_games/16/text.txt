Marc Gasol finished with a double-double of his own, scoring 16 points (5-13 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 6-7 FT) and grabbing 10 rebounds. He recorded only nine points on Saturday against the Sixers, so it was a nice bounce back game offensively for him. With Tony Allen sidelined because of an ankle injury, Jeff Green entered the starting lineup. He shot the ball well, going 4-for-6 from the field and 2-for-2 from the three-point line to score 12 points in 26 minutes. He's now averaging 17 points and 4 rebounds on the year. Coming off the bench, Beno Udrih finished with 15 points (6-8 FG, 1-2 3Pt, 2-2 FT) , five assists and four steals.

He's averaging 26 points and 13 rebounds over his last four games, so he hasn't been slowing down lately. Victor Oladipo was the other player to score 18 points (6-11 FG, 1-3 3Pt, 5-6 FT) , while also adding seven rebounds and two assists. He's gone a combined 14-for-28 from the field over his last last two games, scoring 36 points over that span. Coming off the bench, Dewayne Dedmon notched a double-double with 10 points (4-5 FG, 2-6 FT) and 10 rebounds in 30 minutes. Channing Frye played only 12 minutes in this game as a starter, so Dedmon took most of the extra playing time.

The Grizzlies ' next game will be on the road against the Dallas Mavericks on Tuesday, while the Magic will be at home against the Milwaukee Bucks on Thursday.
